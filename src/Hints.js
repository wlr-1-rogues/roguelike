"You can equip two shields. If you have high enough block it's possible to take no damage from certain monsters (unless perhaps they critical hit).",
'Torches increase your chance to hit a great deal.',
"It's possible to one-shot most monsters with high enough damage, and with a critical hit you can even one-shot high health monsters!",
'You can only hold 6 items. Picking up an item while you inventory is full will destroy the item.',
'Fight in choke points and hallways to only fight one monster at a time. Avoid having multiple monsters attack you from multiple directions.',
"A monster will stop chasing you if they lose sight of you. It's possible to juke them around corners.",
'Monsters will destroy items in their path. Try to find a different angle of attack if a valuable item is between you and a monster.',
'Elixir of health will increase your maximum health, so you can use it instantly. Avoid using other healing items instantly unless you can get the full value of the heal.',
'Equipping items takes turns. It is best to do that out of combat.',
"You can't go back up the stairs, so you should make sure you have everything you want and are prepared before proceeding down.",
'It can be worthwhile to clear the entire floor.'
